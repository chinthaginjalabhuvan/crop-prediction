# Crop-Prediction ðŸŒ¿
#### A simple  machine learning-based system that recommends the best crop to grow and suitable fertilizers based on environmental and soil conditions..

## MOTIVATION ðŸ’ª
Agriculture is a crucial sector for economic growth, especially in countries like India where a significant portion of the population depends on farming for their livelihood.

With the integration of technologies like Machine Learning and Deep Learning, farming practices are becoming more efficient, helping farmers optimize crop yields and enhance productivity.

- This project features a website with two key applications: 

    - Crop Recommendation: Users input soil data, and the application predicts the most suitable crop to grow. 
    
    - Fertilizer Recommendation: The app suggests appropriate fertilizers based on the soil data and crop type to improve soil health and boost crop growth.

## How to use ðŸ’»
- Crop Recommendation system ==> enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. 

- Fertilizer suggestion system ==> Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.
